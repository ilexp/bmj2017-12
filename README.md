# Game Jam Entry: "Spaceshooter Thing"

Experimenting with a team-based gameplay in a top-down dual stick space shooter. 

Graphics assets used are from [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/), audio is partially recycled from an older project of mine, and partially taken from the old Freespace games.

## Running it

**This game requires a gamepad to be played**, no other input methods are supported. It will always use your first gamepad, if you have multiple gamepads plugged in.

Your viewport will be bigger or smaller depending on your screen resolution - a bigger screen is an advantage, but not a requirement.

### The Dev Way

- Clone or download the repository.
- Run `DualityEditor.exe`, let it grab some binaries it needs.
- Close it and run `DualityLauncher.exe`

### The Shortcut

- Download the [binary package](https://github.com/ilexp/bmj2017-12/raw/master/Download.zip)
- Extract and run `DualityLauncher.exe`
